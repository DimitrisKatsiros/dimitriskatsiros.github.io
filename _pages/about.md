Welcome! My name is Dimitris Katsiros and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer.

I studied Electrical and Computer Engineer at National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), 
where my major was Computer Science, which consinsts of 3 flows: Flow L (Computer Software),
 Flow Y (Computer Systems) and Flow D (Networks). Additionally I was enrolled in courses
of Flow S (Signals, Control and Robotics). 

My diploma thesis,  _emotion driven speaker verification_ , was a Deep Learning research, investigating the correlation between speaker verification and speech emotion recognition.
